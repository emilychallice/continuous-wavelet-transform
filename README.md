# continuous-wavelet-transform
[old!] Project on the continuous wavelet transform for PHY407: Computational Physics. Includes separate implementation of the short-time Fourier transform and generic signal convolution.

Write-up and patient data redacted. (If I can find the write-up I'll redact inside it, but it's just an undergrad paper describing the wavelet transform.)

Sample output of cwt.py:
